# Read Later

A lightweight, personal "read later" app for saving web articles, notes, and resources you want to come back to. The project focuses on fast, accessible browsing of saved items, concise tagging for quick scanning, and a minimal, local-first workflow.

Key ideas

- Save links and short notes for articles, blog posts, and resources.
- Use concise, objective tags (1–2 words) so topics are visible at a glance.
- Keep the UI minimal and fast with predictable navigation and clear affordances.

Tech stack

- Next.js (App Router) — server- and client-rendered React framework
- TypeScript — primary language across the codebase
- CSS — for styling (small footprint)

Getting started

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
```

2. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

Notes

- This repository is primarily TypeScript (≈92%). Styling uses plain CSS with a small amount of JavaScript.
- We recently standardized tags to be shorter and more objective to improve scanability.
